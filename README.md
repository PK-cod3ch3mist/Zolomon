# Zolomon
Another single header testing library for C++.

## About
Zolomon is different from other testing frameworks, it allows you to unit test by taking inputs to the function from a .txt file, and can also check multiple functions at once.

The name is inspired from the DC character Zoom, who creates tragic situations for heroes to make them better. Similar to what you can do to your programs using the library.

## How to Use
### Installation and Set Up
Simply download the header and place it along with your project, then pass commands when running the executable to manipulate or selectively run results.

Refer to the docs for more in depth use.
